classdef (Sealed) DelayedIMMF < DelayedMeasurementsFilter
    % Implementation of an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) Filter which can handle delayed and out-of-sequence 
    % measurements to estimate the state of a Markov Jump Linear System (MJLS) in terms of
    % a Gaussian Mixture distribution.
    % The filter was developed by Fischer et al. in the context of sequence-based
    % networked control systems where both control inputs and measurements
    % are transmitted via networks subject to random packet delay and/or loss.

    %   Singapore, July 2012.
